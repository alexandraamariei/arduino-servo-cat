# arduino-servo-cat
An Arduino-based robotic cat using servo motors to simulate leg and head movement(180 degrees).
# Robotic Cat Using Servo Motors 
This is an Arduino project simulating a robotic cat. The cat's legs and head are controlled by 5 servo motors.

# Features
- 5 servo motors: head + 4 legs
- Oscillating movement left and right
- Smooth return to center after each move

# Hardware Used
- Arduino Uno
- 5x SG90 servo motors
- Breadboard + jumper wires
- cardboard frame

# How It Works
This Arduino-powered robotic cat uses five servo motors to move its head and legs in a timed, oscillating pattern. The movement alternates between left and right with delays in between, simulating a playful or walking motion. No sensors or user input are involved â€” the motion is fully automated based on programmed timing.
